# Discover Wallonia
=================
### Paradaise on Earth!
This is a static __webpage__ that i have made with [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/natural-palm-era) .

In this webpage i have tried to portray the tourism sector in [Wallonia](https://www.tourismewallonie.be/).
As the qoute from **__Ibn Battuta__** ;the great traveler in history goes like this:
 
> "Travel leaves you speechless, 
> then turns you into a storyteller.”  :rocket:

I have developed this website to initiate people to discover the beautiful region of Wallonia,Belgium.
Here i have attached you a [_breathtaking picture of Dinant_](https://globalgrasshopper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/best-places-to-visit-in-Belgium-1000x551.jpg); one of the touristic destinations in Wallonia.

I have developed this web page using :
1. HTML  :+:
   * Which containes the main structure of the web page.
2. CSS     :sparkles:
   * Which containes the rules on how the declared coding characters should act. 
3. Markdown  :sparkles:
   * more easier way of characterising content using siple asterisks.
   
   
Besides, below is a table that illustrates the sections of the web page.

  Head             |     Body
------------       |     -------------
web related data   |  content related data
invisible for users| visible for visiters

I hope you will like my first webpage   :+:
